## Introduction
The `watchlist` repository is a REST API platform for movie enthusiasts to come together and share their thoughts and opinions on a wide range of movies. The platform allows administrators to add movies to the site, while registered users can leave reviews for these movies and rank them on a scale from 1 to 5. The overall movie rating is calculated and displayed on each movie's detail page. Token authentication is used for user authentication, ensuring user security.

## Features
- Movie adding by administrators
- Movie ranking and reviewing by users

## Technologies Used
This project was built using a combination of technologies, including:

These technologies were chosen for their versatility, reliability, and ease of use, and were used to create a modern and user-friendly movie-watching platform.

## Getting Started
